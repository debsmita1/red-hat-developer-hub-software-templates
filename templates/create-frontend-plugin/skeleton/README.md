# ${{values.plugin_id}}

Welcome to the ${{values.plugin_id}} plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Software Template_

## Getting started

Your sample frontend plugin has been created, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/${{values.plugin_id}}](http://localhost:3000/${{values.plugin_id}}).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
