# Guide to kickstart front-end plugin development

This Software Template guides you to kickstart your front-end plugin development with fewer clicks.

## Getting started

This template gathers essential information from the user, such as the plugin ID, repository owner, and repository name. It then checks if the repository already exists or if the user wants to create a new one. Upon execution, the template generates a folder structure with all the necessary files, dependencies, UI components, and unit tests to help you get started. This same folder structure is also created when you run `yarn new --select plugin` using the [Backstage CLI|https://backstage.io/docs/tooling/cli/commands#new]. The template includes examples of how to fetch data from external sources, utilizing [Backstage components|https://backstage.io/storybook/] and [Material UI|https://mui.com/material-ui/].

For more details on plugin development, check out the official Backstage documentation.
